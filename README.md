# Supermarket Cashier Simulation

## Project Overview

This project simulates the behavior of cashiers while scanning customers' purchased items in a large supermarket. The simulation involves multiple processes to handle the random arrival of customers, their shopping habits, and the cashier's performance. 

## Features

- **Random Customer Arrival**: Customers arrive at the supermarket at random intervals within a user-defined range.
- **Random Shopping Behavior**: Customers choose random items in random quantities from a predefined list. Shopping time is also random but within a user-defined range.
- **Cashier Selection**: Customers choose a cashier based on queue size, total items in the queue, cashier speed, and cashier's behavior.
- **Item Scanning**: Each cashier takes a random amount of time to scan items, within a user-defined range.
- **Behavior Degradation**: Cashiers' positive behavior (e.g., kindness, smile) degrades over time and they leave the simulation when it reaches zero.
- **Customer Impatience**: Customers may leave without purchasing if they wait too long in a queue.
- **Simulation Termination**: The simulation ends based on user-defined thresholds, such as the number of cashiers who leave, the number of impatient customers, or the income generated by a cashier.

## Implementation Details

- **Interprocess Communication (IPC)**: Uses message queues, semaphores, shared memory, pipes, and signals to handle communication between processes.
- **User-Defined Configuration**: A text file is used to define all configurable parameters such as item list, prices, quantities, and time ranges.
- **Graphics**: Utilizes OpenGL for simple and elegant visual representation of the simulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have `gcc` or any other C compiler installed.
- **OpenGL**: Install OpenGL libraries for graphics.
- **IPC Libraries**: Ensure you have necessary libraries for IPC mechanisms.
